## Overview
MVP: To create a restful API where you can fetch uplifting quotes to mirror or elevate your mood. Add those you find inspirational and store them in the approriate section.





## Process
Beginning with Disney Ideation to channel and refine ideas. The plan was still pretty loose going into the first MVP as I wanted to be certain I didn't bite off more than I could chew!
Make a restful API capable of serving up quotes.

Looking around for a free API I first came across https://zenquotes.io/ which seemed perfect but required a paid key to access keyword searches. I decided to download a dataset to keep things simple and found a nice set of quotes with keywords on Kaggle. 
Even better it was already in JSON and didnt need formatting.

Remembering how to make the server was more of a struggle than I anticipated. It's amazing what a week and a lot of Christmas pudding will do to you. It did mean though that I got some good practice googling about and even running my plans past chatGPT when I got frustrated. Adding error handling was new for me and somewhat overwhelming as there seem to be many different ways to do it. I mostly went with wrapping try catches around the juicy bits of functions but discovered that there is a lot more to learn about possible problems with ports and I'll have to do a deep dive there sometime as it seemed really interesting.
