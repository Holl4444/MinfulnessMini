## Overview
MVP: To create a restful API where you can fetch uplifting quotes to mirror or elevate your mood. Add those you find inspirational and store them in the approriate section.





## Process
Beginning with Disney Ideation to channel and refine ideas. The plan was still pretty loose going into the first MVP as I wanted to be certain I didn't bite off more than I could chew!
Make a restful API capable of serving up quotes.

Looking around for a free API I first came across https://zenquotes.io/ which seemed perfect but required a paid key to access keyword searches. I decided to download a dataset to keep things simple and found a nice set of quotes with keywords on Kaggle.
